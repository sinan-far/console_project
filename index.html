        People use the console to type in command based code like math functions and other functions and stuff and the console will act as a terminal and spit your output 
        You can open it by using the inspect tool on your browser and clicking the console and to print something into the console you can use many 
        languages and syntaxes to print but for javascript it is  “console.log(whatever you need to print)”.
